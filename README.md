GUI to manage ADB and SCRCPY.

Put the python file in a folder with ADB and SCRCPY files and run it.

(https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)

Need python and PyQt5 installed as a pre-req.

"pip install PyQt5"

Allows you to install apps, logcat, reboot, push obbs, disable/enable apps, change DPI and mirror/extend Android display.

Please note that there is an issue with External Display with Android 15.  This not an issue with my script or SCRCPY. Mirror works fine.

All credit to SCRCPY team for there work and to Google for ADB..
